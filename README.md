The purpose of this list is to track and compare software that either enables, or natively supports attribute based access control (ABAC)

# Natively supports Attribute Based Access Control

* [ArchTIS Kojensi](https://www.archtis.com/secure-document-collaboration-software-protecting-classified-information/) - ABAC enabled File Sharing & Document Collaboration
* [AWS IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html) - Use ABAC tags in AWS IAM

(Take with grain of salt, looks like it needs significant configuring)
